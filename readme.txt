For information on installing libraries, see: http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries

This library has been developed to support the CTC-DRA-13-1 Isolated DMX-RDM Shield
on the Arduino platform. 
That being said does not mean that the library won't work with other interfaces. This
library works on the principle of using a RS485 driver to drive a DMX line or act as
a receiver ( DMX Slave )
